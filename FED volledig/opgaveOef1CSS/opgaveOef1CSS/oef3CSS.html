    <h2>Unordered, Ordered, & Definition Lists</h2>
    <p>Lists are an everyday part of life. To-do lists determine what to get done. Navigational routes provide a turn by
        turn list of directions. Recipes
        provide both a list of ingredients and a list of instructions. With a list for nearly everything, it's easy to
        see how they have become popular online.</p>
    <p>HTML provides three different types of lists to choose from when building a page, including unordered, ordered,
        and definition lists. Choosing
        what type of list to use comes down to the content at hand and what is the <em>most semantic choice</em> for
        displaying the content in HTML.</p>
    <p>With three different types of lists to use within HTML there are multiple ways to <em>stylize them using
            CSS</em>. Some of these options include deciding
        what type of bullet to use on a list. Maybe the bullet should be square, round, numeral, alphabetical, or
        perhaps not even exist at all. Also, deciding
        if a list should be displayed vertically or horizontally plays a hand in stylization.</p>
    <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <p>Unordered lsists are purely a list of related items, in which their order does not matter</p>
    <p>Unordered List Demo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iPad</li>
        <li><strong>iPhone 5</strong></li>
        <li>MacBook Air</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ordered List</h2>
    <p>The main difference between an ordered and an unordered list is that with an ordered list the order of which the
        items are represented is important</p>
    <p>Ordered List Demo:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>iPad</li>
        <li>iPhone</li>
        <li>MacBook Air</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Definition List</h2>
    <p>Definition list are used to outline multiple terms and descripions, often in the case of a glossary</p>
    <p>Definition List Demo:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Study</dt>
        <dd>The devotion of time and attention to acquire knowledge on an academic subject, esp. by mean of books </dd>
        <dt>Design</dt>
        <dd>A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object
            before it is built or made purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an
            action, fact, or material object</dd>
        <dt>Business Work</dt>
        <dd>A persons regular occupation, profession, or trade</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Nested Lists</h2>
    <p>One reason lists are extremely powerful within HTML is the ability to nest lists inside one another.Building a
        nested list is fairly simple. Determine
        where a nested list should appear, and rather than closing a list item, begin a new list. Once the nested list
        is complete, close the wrapping list item
        and continue on with the original list.</p>
    <p>Nested Lists Demo:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walk the dog</li>
        <li>Fold laundry</li>
        <li>
            Go to the laundry and buy:
            <ul>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mow the lawn</strong></li>
        <li>Make dinner</li>
    </ol>
