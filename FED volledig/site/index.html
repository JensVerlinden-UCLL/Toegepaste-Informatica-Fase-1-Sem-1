                <p>üö© When people are asked about their hobby, they often answer with sports and other activities which
                    require a lot of effort. Fortunately, there are also passions that you can exercise from your lazy
                    chair or bed, and no, I'm not talking about gaming. As one could already tell from the site name, I
                    want to talk about the rather unknown hobby of <strong>vexillology</strong> which is defined as the
                    scientific study of the separation, symbolism and use of flags. However, one does not have to be a
                    scientist to be a <em>vexillologist</em>, or rather a <em>vexillophile</em>, as since 1961 there are
                    people all over the world who do not practice this study professionally, but for relaxation and
                    personal interest. There are even people everywhere who choose a different flag from their
                    collection every day and hang it on a stick or on their balcony. In this way you can let the whole
                    neighborhood enjoy your passion, as long as the flag does not have a negative connotation of course.
                    The purpose of this site is therefore also to spread the term 'vexillology' and to
                    introduce visitors to the site in an interactive way with what I believe to be the best aspects of
                    this rather varied subject.

            <h2>~ History ~</h2>
            <div class="grid-history">
                <p>üìú The term 'vexillology' was first coined in 1959 years ago as a combination of the words <abbr
                        title="Latin word for flag">'vexillum'</abbr> and <abbr
                        title="Greek word for study">'-logia'</abbr>. However, it was only 2 years later that the study
                    was officialized and separated from <abbr title="study of armorial bearings">heraldry</abbr> by the
                    American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_Smith">Whitney Smith</a> who devoted his
                    life to organizing flag organizations and meetings. Professional vexillologists have been working
                    daily from that historical moment on the underlying sociology of flags, which can lead to a correct
                    interpretation of their designs, colors and dimensions used. Non-professional vexillophiles also
                    contribute to the flag industry and can participate in the biennial <a
                        href="https://fiav.org/icv-list/">International Congress of Vexillology</a> to meet their
                    favorite flag designers or <em>vexillographers</em>, for example.</p>

                            that usage in a serious fashion is so recent that the term for it did not appear in print
                            until 1959.‚Äù

                <p>üåé Since the inception of the study, many organizations around vexillology have been established
                    worldwide, the most famous of which is undoubtedly the <abbr
                        title="F√©d√©ration International des Associations Vexillologiques">FIAV</abbr> which is
                    considered the International Body of Vexillology. The FIAV itself is further subdivided into various
                    national organizations such as the German 'Deutsche Gesselschaft f√ºr Flaggenkunde' and consists of a
                    total of 50 associations and institutes that are involved in this field. Although the study is
                    slowly dying out in academia, vexillology is enjoying great success online through Internet forums
                    such as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/">Reddit page r/vexillology</a> and the
                    YouTube community devoted to flags with well-known members such as <a
