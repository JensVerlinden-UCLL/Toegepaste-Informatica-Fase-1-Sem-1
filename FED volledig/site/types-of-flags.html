                            Just think of parties, football matches, <em>embassies</em> in big cities, and so on. They
                            can serve as a symbol of unity, as signal elements or simply as decoration. There are in
                            total so many types of flags that it is almost impossible to discuss them all on 1 simple
                            webpage. That is why we will focus on the following 3 categories.</p>

                    <h3>National flags</h3>
                    <p>Since 2400 BC, man has marked his territory with the use of flags that symbolize the ruling group
                        of that area. For example, the current <span class="example">Scottish flag</span> has been
                        around since the year 832 and the <span class="example">tricolor of Belgium</span>, my own
                        homeland, only came 1000 years later with the revolution. At the time of writing, <time
                            datetime="2022-10-22">October 22 2022</time>, 196 states and their flags have been
                        recognized internationally, with the country and <span class="example">flag of South
                            Sudan</span> being the newest.</p>

                    <p>Territorial regions do not need to be recognized by others to declare themselves as a nation. In
                        such instances we talk about <em>micronations</em> and there are a lot of them all over the
                        world. Some were created as a joke like the <span class="example">Republic of Molossia</span>
                        that only includes 1 house, and others take themselves very seriously selling official
                        passports, honorary titles and parcels. This is again the case with the <span
                            class="example">Principality of Sealand</span>. Most of these micronations also have their
                        own flags with some being more professional than others.</p>

                        also includes appropriate flags. Well-known examples are those of the former <span

                        former and immense colonial empire of Great Britain also has a legacy due to the

                        these too have a flag. Although in principle they cannot be made official as the planets are not
                        inhabited and the flag designs are therefore all unrecognized, there are still a lot of
                        vexillologists who are concerned with this category and especially with designing a flag for the
                        perhaps soon to be inhabited <span class="example">planet Mars</span>. Even for our own planet
                        there is no official flag yet, but the <span class="example"><abbr

                        that one is affiliated with, such as a sports club. This association species is known for its
                        abundance of <em>tifos</em> and flags. This is especially the case with hard core team sports
                        such as those of the German football club <span class="example">Borussia-Dortmund</span> who are
                        known for their beautiful tifos or the Belgian club with the same colors of which I myself am a

                    <p>Whether they are in power or not, many political parties are also characterized by a coat of arms
                        or banner. This can bring supporters together through <em>patriotism</em>, which is the case,
                        for example, with the party of 'Vlaams Belang' and the <span class="example">flag of
                            Flanders</span>. Such a flag can also be characterized by the cultural views of the party
                        or country, which is very clear with the <span class="example">flag of the Qing
                            Dynasty</span>, which has a triangular variant and is also called the 'Yellow Dragon Flag'
                        because of the predominant color which fits very well with the culture of the country.</p>

                        accepted and that of course also applies to this site. That is why I would also like to mention
                        the flags of all different genders and/or sexualities ranging from the very specific <span

                        it, I assume that everyone is familiar with the <span class="example">Pride flag</span>, which
                        has changed many times over the years and stands as a symbol for the LGBTQIA+.</p>

                        make it an interactive event. This is how official <em>flag elections</em> come about where
                        every resident or member can submit their own design and democracy decides which flag is elected
                        (often after another intervention by an appointed jury to avoid hilarities). A well-known flag
                        that has been elected in this way is the one of the US state of <span

                        referendum was also held in <span class="example">New Zealand</span>, but there was no winner,
                        so the flag remained the same.</p>

                        Even if you now walk through the streets of Italy, you will see a <span class="example">rainbow
