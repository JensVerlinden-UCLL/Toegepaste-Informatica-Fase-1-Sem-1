                    <p>You might already know, but this is the official flag of the Asian country Nepal and it is also
                        the
                        only national flag that does not have the shape of a rectangle. The reason for this is that the
                        two
                        <em>triangles</em> symbolize the well-known Himalayas and the 2 major religions of the country:
                        Hinduism and
                        Buddhism. Furthermore, the flag also contains a sun and crescent moon that were actually
                        represented
                        <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pre_1962_Flag_of_Nepal.png">by faces until
                            1962</a>. The carmine red and the blue border respectively symbolize the rhododendron,
                        the national flower of Nepal, and the peace that the country knows.

                    <p>This flag is the favorite of many because of its many original aspects: the banner of the
                        Republic of
                        Venice. The most striking thing about this flag is undoubtedly the <em>fringes</em> on the right
                        side that
                        represent the 6 parts of the <a class='location'

                        while preventing wind from damaging the main part. This part is
                        characterized by the proud lion that, depending on the version of the flag, poses with another
                        object: The Bible in times of peace and a sword in war. Although the flag is no longer official
                        since the dissolution of the Republic, you can still see it hanging from many balconies or
                        gondolas
                        in Venice.

                    <div class="unusual-image"><img src="images/flag-sicily.png" alt="Flag of Sicily"></div>
                    <p>This flag also has an Italian character as it is that of the autonomous island of Sicily.
                        However,
                        many vexillologists consider its design rather terrifying because of the central triskeles
                        symbol
                        with the head of the mythological gorgon <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa">Medusa</a>. The number 3
                        therefore represents the 3 cape points that characterize the area. The symbol is also very
                        similar
                        to that of the flag of the <span class="example">Isle of Man</span>, although there are still
                        significant differences. The flag
                        is colored diagonally in half in red, respectively the colors of the cities of <a

                        was designed by "Loco Joe" Carollo, a paranoid and unstable man who has a lot on his criminal
                        record, but he is also a former mayor of Miami, so his horrible design has not been disapproved

                        is also known for its odd size. As one
                        can see, it is not an everyday rectangle, but it resembles a Nepalese flag stretched across the
                        width. The red, blue and white design with stars of course refers to the US flag and the
                        triangular
                        field symbolizes the hills and valleys of the state. The large circular disk in the center of
                        the
                        triangle forms an 'O' and thus refers to the name of the state. The thirteen stars grouped
                        around
                        the 'O' represent the original states of the United States, and the four stars added to the apex

                    <p>Until 2011, Libya had perhaps the most boring national flag in the world: a simple green
                        rectangle
                        because at that time it was the only country with a 1-colour flag. The message behind this was
                        the
                        color green universally symbolizes Islam and it also traditionally re-enacted the historical
                        Libyan
                        region of Tripolitania where the capital <a

                        is located. Furthermore, this flag has 2 versions
                        in proportion and it was adopted in 1977 by the then and well-known leader Gaddafi who thought
                        that
                        the banner fit well with his political philosophy described in <a

                        After its abolition, the flag is still used by Gaddafi loyalists.

                        flag design, the design is very distinctive and full of symbolism. The city in the Krasnoyarsk

                    <p>Over the years, there have been many proposals for an official flag for Antarctica, such as <a
                            href="http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/aq!.html#gb">
                            Graham
                            Bartram's 1996 proposal
                        </a> and <a href="http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/aq!.html#ws">Whitney Smith's 1978 proposal</a>.
                        However, it was Evan Townsed's flag that
                        was the only one recognized by the members of the <abbr
                            title="Antarctic Treaty System">ATS</abbr>. This design is now known as <strong>'True
                            South'</strong> and
                        is divided into parts with the colors white and navy blue that represent the polar nights and
                        days.
                        In the center there is a diamond, the white part of which symbolizes the icebergs and pressure
                        ridges of Antarctica and the blue part of which is a south-facing compass arrow. </p>
